      our bodies when to sleep, rise, and eatâ€”regulating many physiological processes.
      This internal body clock is affected by environmental cues, like sunlight and
      temperature, and determines whether one feels wide-awake and energized or tired
      and depleted at different times of the day. When circadian rhythms are disrupted,
      sleeping and eating patterns can run amok. Let's see if your circadian rhythm
      is functioning well. How many hours a day do you sleep?
